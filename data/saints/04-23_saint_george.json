According to holy tradition, he was a soldier in the Roman army. Saint George’s mother Saint Polychronia is believed to have come from Syria Palaestina and his father Saint Gerontios is believed to be of Syrian Cappadocian origin. He became a member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman emperor Diocletian, but was executed as part of the Diocletianic persecution. He is one of the most venerated saints, heroes, and megalomartyrs in Christianity, and he has been especially venerated as a military saint since the Crusades. He is also prominently venerated by the Druze, and by some Muslim groups, as a martyr of monotheistic faith.",
