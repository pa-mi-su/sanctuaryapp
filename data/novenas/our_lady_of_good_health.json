Permit me, your humble and devoted client, to remind you of the joy you received at the instance of the most Sacred Incarnation of our Divine Lord and during the nine months you carried Him in your chaste womb. I wish most sincerely that I could renew, or even increase, that joy by the fervor of my prayers. O Tender Mother of the Afflicted! grant me under my present necessities that special protection you have promised to those who devoutly commemorate this ineffable joy. Relying on the infinite mercies of your Divine Son, trusting that those who ask should receive, and penetrated with confidence in your powerful prayers, I most humbly entreat you to intercede for me. I beg you to obtain for me the favors which I petition for in this novena, if it be the Holy Will of God to grant them; and if not, to ask for me whatever graces I most stand in need of. (mention request here…) I desire by this Novena, which I now offer in your honor, to prove the lively confidence I have in your intercession. Accept it, I beseech you, in honor of that supernatural love and joy with which your Immaculate Heart was replenished during the abode of your Divine Son in your womb, in veneration of which, I offer you the sentiments of my heart. O Mother of God, accept these salutations in union with the respect and veneration with which the Angel Gabriel first hailed you Full of Grace. I wish most sincerely that they may become so many gems in the crown of your glory, which will increase in brightness to the end of the world. I beseech you, O Comfortress of the Afflicted, by the joy you received when the Word was made flesh, to obtain for me the favors and graces which I now implore through your powerful intercession. For this end I offer you all the good works which have ever been performed in your honor.
