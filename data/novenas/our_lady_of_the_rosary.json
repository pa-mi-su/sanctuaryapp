The Glory Be: Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end, amen. Then begin the first decade of the set of mysteries you are praying today. Our Father Ten Hail Marys Glory Be Fatima Prayer: “Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of They mercy.” Repeat for decades 2 through 5. End the Rosary with the Hail, Holy Queen: Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears! Turn, then, O most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God. R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Let us Pray. O God, whose only-begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain, and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-9:hover, #share-native-9:hover, #share-copy-9:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '9'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/our-lady-of-the-rosary-novena/'; var pageTitle = \"Our Lady of the Rosary Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();\n\n(function() { var dailyCTA = document.getElementById('branch-daily-prayer-9'); if (dailyCTA && typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { var link = dailyCTA.querySelector('a'); if (link) { link.addEventListener('click', function() { var eventData = { event_category: 'conversion', novena: \"Our Lady of the Rosary Novena\", day: '9', novena_slug: 'our-lady-of-the-rosary-novena', source: 'daily_prayer_cta' }; if (window.abTestDownloadFunnel) { eventData.ab_test = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.testName; eventData.ab_variant = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.variant; } window.trackEvent('daily_prayer_cta_clicked', eventData); }); } } })();\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the Our Lady of the Rosary Novena\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nMore About Our Lady of the Rosary\n\nRead more about the patron saint of Malaga, Toledo, Rosario, Santa Fe, Cavite, San Nicolás de los Arroyos, Santos, Melilla, Trujillo, Cáceres, Colombia, Manizales, Puyo, Pastaza, North Carolina, Bohol, Guatemala, Surigao del Norte, Manila, Quezon City, West Virginia, Seseña, Ontígola, Olías del Rey, Montearagón, Lagartera, Huerta de Valdecarábanos, Brenes, Palma Cuata, Zacatecas Lima, Peru on the Our Lady of the Rosary Saint Page.\n\nRelated Novena\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe Novena",
