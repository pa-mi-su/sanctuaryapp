Blasphemy is a poisoned arrow, wounding His Divine Heart continually. He told me that He would give me a Golden Arrow with which to wound Him delightfully and heal the poisonous wounds caused by sin.”\n\nJesus gave to Sister Marie the Golden Arrow prayer, which is included at the end of Day 9 of the novena, and told her that every time she recited it, she would lovingly wound His Heart.\n\nPromises of Christ to Those who follow the devotion:\n\nBy offering My Face to My Eternal Father, nothing will be refused, and the conversion of many sinners will be obtained.By My Holy Face, they will work wonders, appease the anger of God and draw down mercy on sinners.All those who honor My Face in a spirit of reparation will by so doing perform the office of the pious Veronica.According to the care they take in making reparation to My Face disfigured by blasphemers, so will I take care of their souls which have been disfigured by sin. My Face is the Seal of the Divinity, which has the virtue of reproducing in souls the image of God.Those who by words, prayers or writings defend My cause in the Work of Reparation, especially My priests, I will defend before My Father, and will give them My Kingdom.As in a kingdom they can procure all that is desired with a coin stamped with the King’s effigy, so in the Kingdom of Heaven they will obtain all they desire with the precious coin of My Holy Face.Those who on earth contemplate the wounds of My Face shall in Heaven behold it radiant with glory.They will receive in their souls a bright and constant irradiation of My Divinity, that by their likeness to My Face they shall shine with particular splendor in Heaven.1 will defend them, I will preserve them and I assure them of Final Perseverance.",
