Amen.\n\nV. Come, O Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, and kindle in them the fire of Thy love. Send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created. R.

(mention request here…) Thou knowest, O Mary, how often our souls have been the sanctuaries of thy Son who hates iniquity. Obtain for us then a deep hatred of sin and that purity of heart which will attach us to God alone so that our every thought, word and deed may tend to His greater glory. Obtain for us also a spirit of prayer and self-denial that we may recover by penance what we have lost by sin and at length attain to that blessed abode where thou art the Queen of angels and of men. Amen.\n\nPray the Novena Prayer and Concluding Prayer\n\nAN ACT OF CONSECRATION TO OUR LADY OF THE MIRACULOUS MEDAL Virgin Mother of God, Mary Immaculate, we dedicate and consecrate our selves to thee under the title of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.

I vividly remember that she told me when she was still alive that I try my best to attend the feast day mass in honour of our Lady every year which I always try to attend, not until covid were we stuck in other country.\n\nDuring COVID I was detected to have brain tumour I was so down because my only child was only 15 years she still need my guidance and care and I was undergoing marital problems it was the OUR LADY OF MIRACULOUS MEDAL that help me to overcome my challenges and most of all the brain tumour was benign and the surgery was successful for 2 hours until now with my annual MRI no recurrence of the said tumour is detected. She is my refuge and comfort. I have made a special thanksgiving prayer her that I pray everyday.\n\nfrom A.M.\n\nI was raised in a Catholic family and church from the time I was born until the age of 14. I knew God and believed in him, but I had no real connection. I strayed from my faith at the age of 15. Within the same time, I began abusing substances. By the age of 22 I was lost, desperate, in a deep state of addiction, and in need of Gods grace and salvation.\n\nNothing seemed to aid in my recovery, until my mother gave me the miraculous medal one day and said Pray. Say the novena. Wear the miraculous medal. Just try it.\n\nI did, and after numerous attempts of trying to get sober that did not work, somehow, by the grace of God, the miraculous medal did. I said this novena everyday for 30 days and the next thing I knew, I was 30 days sober and stunned. A miracle it was, a miracle it is. I continue to wear my medal across my neck and pray this novena in moments of weakness, and it has not failed me yet.\n\nThank you Virgin Mary for your protection, and thank you Lord God above for your grace. I stand here alive and whole today, forever astonished by the miraculous work you have done in my life.\n\nfrom G.J.\n\nI prayed this Miraculous Medal Novena, and on the 3rd day of my Novena, an answered prayer I received.\n\nI prayed for my daughter to get a job and it’s been quite a while since she has been applying for a job.\n\nTomorrow on the Feast Day she will start a new job!\n\nThank you, Mama Mary.\n\nfrom E.B.\n\nI prayed this Miraculous Medal novena, and I would love to thank God and Mary for performing a miracle on my quadriceps and not having surgery due to an exercise accident. Thank you Jesus.\n\nfrom T.L.\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the Miraculous Medal Novena\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nMore About St Catherine Laboure\n\nRead more about the patron saint of special graces, architects, miners, prisoners on the St Catherine Laboure Saint Page.\n\nRelated Novena\n\nImmaculate Heart of Mary Novena",
