This part of Italy belonged to the Papal States, a geographic area controlled by the Pope. The Papal States came about in the Middle Ages when the people of Italy needed defense against the bellicose Lombards, and the Pope was the most stable leader in the area.\n\nPeregrine’s family were actually in opposition to the Papal State, and because of this, they were under interdict. (The pope can place a nation or area under interdict if they are opposing the Church in a dangerous way, and this means that sacraments are invalid in that area. The purpose of an interdict is to place pressure on the dissenting leader to bring them and their area back into harmony with the Church.)\n\nSt. Philip Benizi, head of the Servite Order, was sent to heal the division and end the interdict. He preached in Peregrine’s hometown of Forli, and Peregrine, then eighteen years old and following his family’s anti-papal prejudice, ridiculed St. Philip and attacked him.\n\nSt. Philip fled for life, but God used this event to bring Peregrine to repentance and conversion.\n\nPeregrine sought out St. Philip and begged his forgiveness, which was readily granted. Peregrine realized that the path to true holiness was in following Christ and the Church. He embarked upon a new life of prayer and works of charity.\n\nHe joined the Servite Order in Siena and was ordained to the priesthood.\n\nPeregrine was eventually stationed in Forlì and moved the people through his holiness, care for the sick and needy, and eloquent preaching. One miraculous story of his life tells that, reminscent of Christ, he multiplied grain and wine during a famine in the region. Due to his wisdom, he became known as “the Angel of Good Counsel.”\n\nPeregrine was called to extraordinary sacrifices and sufferings. For example, he chose to stand whenever and wherever he could, and no matter how exhausted he was. Due to this penitential practice of standing at all times, Peregrine developed varicose veins, and subsequently more serious problems with his foot and leg.\n\nPeregrine became the patron saint of cancer patients in the following way: He was sixty years old when his right leg got infected due to cancer. Medical expertise at the time was limited, and the doctor saw no alternative but to perform an amputation on his leg. Peregrine was resigned to our Lord’s will on the matter, and the night before the amputation he spent hours deep in prayer before a Crucifix. It was then that Christ appeared to him, descending from the Cross, and touched his leg.\n\nThe doctor came the next day and was astonished to find that the infection and cancer were completely gone. The doctor made this miracle known far and wide, and Peregrine’s fame spread as a result.\n\nSaint Peregrine died of a fever on May 1, 1345. He was 85 years old. Some of the sick people who came to honor him were healed of their ailments through his prayers.\n\nSt. Peregrine was canonized in 1726 by Pope Benedict XIII.",
