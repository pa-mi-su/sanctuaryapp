You know that I have special confidence in you and that, after Jesus and Mary, I place all my hope of salvation in you, for you are especially powerful with God and will never abandon your faithful servants. Therefore I humbly invoke you and commend myself, with all who are dear to me and all that belong to me, to your intercession. I beg of you, by your love for Jesus and Mary, not to abandon me during life and to assist me at the hour of my death. Glorious Saint Joseph, spouse of the Immaculate Virgin, obtain for me a pure, humble, charitable mind, and perfect resignation to the divine Will. Be my guide, my father, and my model through life that I may merit to die as you did in the arms of Jesus and Mary. Loving Saint Joseph, faithful follower of Jesus Christ, I raise my heart to you to implore your powerful intercession in obtaining from the Divine Heart of Jesus all the graces necessary for my spiritual and temporal welfare, particularly the grace of a happy death, and the special grace I now implore: (mention request here…) Guardian of the Word Incarnate, I feel confident that your prayers on my behalf will be graciously heard before the throne of God. Amen.\n\nSaint Joseph, I thank God for your privilege of having been chosen by God to be the foster-father of His Divine Son. As a token of your own gratitude to God for this your greatest privilege, obtain for me the grace of a very devoted love for Jesus Christ, my God and my Savior. Help me to serve Him with some of the self-sacrificing love and devotion which you had while on this earth with Him. Grant that through your intercession with Jesus, your foster-Son, I may reach the degree of holiness God has destined for me, and save my soul.\n\nRemember, most pure spouse of Mary, ever Virgin, my loving protector, Saint Joseph, that no one ever had recourse to your protection or asked for your aid without obtaining relief. Confiding, therefore, in your goodness, I come before you and humbly implore you. Despise not my petitions, foster-father of the Redeemer, but graciously receive them. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Each lists a genealogy of Jesus from King David, one from the royal line of Solomon, the other through Nathan, who was a son of David and Bathsheba.\n\nIn St. Matthew’s gospel, Joseph obeys the angel and takes Mary as his wife, then after Jesus is born in Bethlehem, Joseph again follows the angel’s directions to him to take the family to Egypt to escape Herod’s wrath (the slaughter of the Holy Innocents).\n\nWhen the Holy Family enter Egypt, the pagan statues of their gods crumble and fall, but no one in Egypt knows that it is because this humble family, which contains the true God, has entered their area.\n\nSome years later, Herod dies, and the angel once again tells Joseph they can return, this time to Nazareth. In St. Matthew’s gospel, the people of Nazareth call Jesus “the carpenter’s son.” The translation could indicate some other type of manual worker of a skilled artisan trade, but traditionally he was known as a carpenter. The early Church Fathers (including St. Justin Martyr) confirm that Jesus was a carpenter, who made yokes and ploughs for oxen.\n\nWhen Jesus is 12 years old, and the Holy Family has visited the Temple in Jerusalem for Passover, Joseph and Mary discover Jesus talking to the teachers of the Law, and answering their questions. This is of course the fifth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary: the finding of the child Jesus in the Temple.\n\nThe Happy Death of St. Joseph\n\nCatholic Tradition tells us that Joseph died in the arms of Jesus and Mary, before Jesus began His public ministry.\n\nReason supports this Tradition in the following two ways: first, had Joseph been alive during Jesus’ Passion and Crucifixion, the heroic saint would fought like a lion to rescue his beloved foster-son. God in His wisdom knew that this would not serve the divine purposes, and so instead He made St. Joseph patron of the dying, because he had the happiest death in the arms of Jesus and Mary.\n\nSecond, when Jesus is on the Cross, He gives His mother into the protection and care of the Apostle John, something that never would have happened if Joseph had still been alive. (Nor, by extension, if Mary and Joseph had had biological children; this is thus evidence also that the “brothers and sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the Bible are in fact cousins and other more distant relations.)\n\nHow St. Joseph Met the Virgin Mary\n\nWe can glean more on St. Joseph’s life through the witness of private revelation, given to various saints and mystics over the centuries. One common story among them is that, the Virgin Mary had been consecrated to God in the Temple from an early age, but it was shown that she should marry, so all the eligible male descendants of David were gathered together for the selection.\n\nJoseph was holding a dead branch, standing in the back of the gathering, not deigning to consider himself worthy to be the husband of so virtuous and beautiful a young woman. Mary and the priests were awaiting God to show forth His selection, when the branch in Joseph’s hand miraculously blossomed with white lilies.\n\nJoseph and Mary, both having consecrated themselves to God earlier in their lives, remained virgins throughout their marriage, thus demonstrating both the vocation of marriage and that of consecrated virginity for the Kingdom. (Protestants are thus in grave error when they, misinterpreting the Scriptures, claim that Joseph and Mary had marital relations and biological children who were brothers and sisters to Jesus.)\n\nSt. Joseph in the Church\n\nIn 1962, Pope St. John XXIII added St. Joseph to the Canon of the Mass, right after that of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in 2013, Pope Francis added St. Joseph to the three other Eucharistic Prayers.\n\nIn 1870, Pope Pius IX named St. Joseph the patron of the Universal Church. Pope Pius XII changed this feast to that of Saint Joseph the Worker on May 1st.\n\nPius XII chose this date to combat the same date chosen by Marxist labor movements, demonstrating that St. Joseph, as patron of workers, is the true model of the dignity of human work.\n\nThe novena to St. Joseph can be prayed for finding employment, selling your house, finding your spouse, for purity, or for any other need that you have. You can pray it for 9 days or make it a 30 day novena to St. Joseph, either is good.\n\nMore Resources on St. Joseph\n\nThe Cord of St. Joseph, for Purity\n\nFor men struggling to overcome lust, I recommend a little known sacramental called the Cord of St. Joseph.\n\nThe Cord is a simple rope with knots in it that you wear around your waist, hidden under your clothes. You have it blessed by a priest with a certain prayer, and each day you say a prayer that St. Joseph obtains the graces you need.\n\nI ordered the Cord from here, and it had the prayers with it.\n\nPrivate Revelation on St. Joseph\n\nMultiple books exist describing St. Joseph and Our Lady’s life. I recommend The Life of St. Joseph by Maria Cecilia Baij (can be hard to find or expensive), or The Life of the Mother of God by Mary of Agreda.\n\nRemember that, we as Catholics are not bound to believe in any private revelation, but the above two books have the endorsement of bishops of the Church, that they do not contradict the truths of the Faith.\n\nBurying a Statue of St. Joseph to Sell Your House\n\nSome people bury a statue of St. Joseph to sell their house. This practice can be superstitious, which is a sin that runs contrary to the Catholic Faith.\n\nInstead, you are much better served to faithfully, with trust in God, pray the novena to St. Joseph to sell your house. God rewards such faith, but superstition, where one tries to manipulate God or the saints to do what you want, is never rewarded.",
