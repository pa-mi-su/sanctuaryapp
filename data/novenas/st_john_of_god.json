Amen.\n\nSaint John of God, heavenly Patron of the Sick, I come to you in prayer to seek your help in my present sickness. Through the love which Jesus had for you in choosing you for the sublime vocation of serving the sick, and through the tender affection with which the Blessed Virgin Mary placed upon your head a crown of thorns as a symbol of the sufferings you would undergo in the service of the sick to attain to your crown of glory, I beg you to intercede for me to Jesus and Mary that They may grant me a cure, if this should be according to the Will of God. How patiently you bore the sufferings of your own disease! Teach me to carry with cheerful resignation the cross that God has given me. Let me never complain or lose courage. Help me to understand that suffering is a very important means of sanctifying my soul, of atoning for my many sins, and of reaping a plentiful harvest of merit for Heaven. I trust in your great love for the sick and in the power of your intercession to help them. Help me, good St. John, and beg the God whose name you bear to touch me as He touched the sick while on earth, that through His almighty power health may return to my body. And as you derived strength in your own sufferings from the crucifix, so may I be able to say what you did to Jesus Crucified, Lord, Thy thorns are my roses and Thy sufferings my paradise. Good Saint John, lover of those who suffer and special Patron of the Sick, I confidently place before you my earnest petition (mention request here…) I beg you to recommend my request to Mary, the Mother of Sorrows and Health of the Sick, that both Mary and you may present it to Jesus, the Divine Physician. Saint John of God, patron of the Sick and beloved of Jesus and Mary, pray to Them for me and obtain my request.

Amen.\n\nSaint John of God, heavenly Patron of the Sick, I come to you in prayer to seek your help in my present sickness. Through the love which Jesus had for you in choosing you for the sublime vocation of serving the sick, and through the tender affection with which the Blessed Virgin Mary placed upon your head a crown of thorns as a symbol of the sufferings you would undergo in the service of the sick to attain to your crown of glory, I beg you to intercede for me to Jesus and Mary that They may grant me a cure, if this should be according to the Will of God. How patiently you bore the sufferings of your own disease! Teach me to carry with cheerful resignation the cross that God has given me. Let me never complain or lose courage. Help me to understand that suffering is a very important means of sanctifying my soul, of atoning for my many sins, and of reaping a plentiful harvest of merit for Heaven. I trust in your great love for the sick and in the power of your intercession to help them. Help me, good St. John, and beg the God whose name you bear to touch me as He touched the sick while on earth, that through His almighty power health may return to my body. And as you derived strength in your own sufferings from the crucifix, so may I be able to say what you did to Jesus Crucified, Lord, Thy thorns are my roses and Thy sufferings my paradise. Good Saint John, lover of those who suffer and special Patron of the Sick, I confidently place before you my earnest petition (mention request here…) I beg you to recommend my request to Mary, the Mother of Sorrows and Health of the Sick, that both Mary and you may present it to Jesus, the Divine Physician. Saint John of God, patron of the Sick and beloved of Jesus and Mary, pray to Them for me and obtain my request. (repeat this three times)\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be St John of God, pray for us!\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-7:hover, #share-native-7:hover, #share-copy-7:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '7'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/st-john-of-god-novena/'; var pageTitle = \"St John of God Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();\n\n(function() { var dailyCTA = document.getElementById('branch-daily-prayer-7'); if (dailyCTA && typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { var link = dailyCTA.querySelector('a'); if (link) { link.addEventListener('click', function() { var eventData = { event_category: 'conversion', novena: \"St John of God Novena\", day: '7', novena_slug: 'st-john-of-god-novena', source: 'daily_prayer_cta' }; if (window.abTestDownloadFunnel) { eventData.ab_test = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.testName; eventData.ab_variant = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.variant; } window.trackEvent('daily_prayer_cta_clicked', eventData); }); } } })();",
