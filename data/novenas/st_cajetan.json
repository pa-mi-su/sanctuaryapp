Amen.\n\nO glorious St. Cajetan, you studied to be a lawyer, but when you felt that the Lord was calling you to His service, you abandoned everything and became a priest. You excelled in virtues, shunning all material rewards for your labor, helping the many unemployed people of your time. You provided loans without interest and you attracted benefactors who donated to your resources so that you could go on with your activities. Look on us with mercy. We wish to find employment that could help us and our families live with dignity. Listen to our petitions, dear saint; you, who could easily give up the food on your table for the needy, bring our petitions to Jesus (mention request here…) Amen.\n\nYou were a model of virtue among the priests of your time, O St. Cajetan. You sought not to receive payments from your ministry, and you taught people how to pray the rosary and develop devotions to saints. You were truly a spiritual shepherd, and your concern was always focused on the salvation of souls. But despite this, you were also aware that with hungry stomachs, the faithful would have difficulty in understanding God’s Word. You embarked to help them, not just by giving them bread but helping them gain their living by work. Look on us with pity, O glorious saint. We have many unemployed people in our midst and their families go hungry. We ask you to guide the fathers and mothers who are looking for work. Amen.\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be St Cajetan, pray for us.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

You always prayed for unity in the Church, asking laypersons, priests, and bishops to support the Pope through preaching, prayer, and sacrifices. You see the Church as the bride of Christ, the sacrament by which men and women can become holy. You worked hard for the return of the Protestants to the Catholic Church, and you preached against Protestant reformers who were attacking the heart of Catholic teachings. Teach us then to work for unity in our Church and at the same time, to defend her from sects and religious movements that attack her. Inspire us to follow your path.

My son passed his pharmacist intern oral exam.\n\nfrom G.C.\n\nMy daughter and i prayed and requested God and thru our blessed mother as well as this novena… as she prepared (just for 3 days) and took her praxis exam last October 13, 2025. Result came after a month and she passed it. Tomorrow, December 2nd, she needs to take another praxis exam and we continue invoking the intercession of St. Joseph and with God’s mercy and grace, may our request be granted. Thank you and may we all continue trusting on God’s abundant blessings.\n\nfrom T.P.\n\nShortly after making the novena for my son he received an e mail offering him a full time job .Thanks to St Cajetan and St Anthony.\n\nfrom M.H.\n\nI am extremely happy to share my testimony with you. I did pray St. Cajetan’s Novena from Sep 19, 2025 and on the eighth day, I received a call from the company I had worked 2 decades back. I am joining my new job on 30th October, 2025.\n\nAll glory and honour to Lord Jesus Christ! Grateful for the intercession by St. Cajetan.\n\nfrom L.S.\n\nI recently had a new business opportunity that I embarked on and after making the investment into it, the party went missing for 1 month and I feared for the worst.\n\nI began this novena for help and guidance from St Cajetan and after the novena dor day 8, the party contacted me and explained the situation. Everything was still going on and there were some signal issues as the project is offsite and network issues are difficult there.\n\nThank you St Cajetan for your prayers and intercessions and I continue to ask for your prayers and guidance on this project and others I am doing now.\n\nfrom D.G.\n\nWhen praying to Cajetan Novena I got offered the job I wanted the same day of the interview.\n\nfrom E.M.\n\nI got job interview calls on day 7 of the novena.\n\nfrom E.K.\n\nI would like to write my testimony as my thanks to God and thanks to St. Cajetan.\n\nAs I was jobless, far away from my native land, I was sad and hurt deep inside myself because I saw myself stuck and saw my dreams shattered into pieces because of some individuals who forbid me to advance due to their jealousy and personal interest.\n\nI needed to start again.\n\nAs I saw one day about the Novena to St. Cajetan, patron of the jobless, I prayed 9 days straight, praying to God and to him to give me soon a job so that I can finally fulfill my dreams and go back to my native land. After finishing the Novena and after more than 60 online application and 6 job interviews, I finally found a job and today I will start my training.\n\nThank you God, Thank you Jesus, Thank you Mary and thank you St. Cajetan for listening to my prayers. You heard this prayer of mine and You allow me to advance with my life projects when everything seems hopeless. You did not allow evil to have the final word. I will be forever grateful for this grace given and I promise to thank you once I reach heaven.\n\nAmen\n\nfrom N.R.G.\n\nJob gained after despite being 2nd choice after interview. Then inexplicably next day job offered.\n\nfrom C.C.\n\nMy Granddaughter got a job day 6 of Novena, thank you St Cajetan and God our Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nfrom D.D.\n\nI am giving this testimony on behalf of someone who runs a school for adults whereby for sometime students have been withdrawing from school.\n\nHe has been praying the Novena and by his intercession students are coming back one after another.\n\nfrom H.K\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the St Cajetan Novena - Prayers for Employment\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nMore About St Cajetan\n\nRead more about the patron saint of bankers, unemployed people, workers, gamblers, document controllers, job seekers, Albania, Italy, Ħamrun (Malta), Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Labo, Camarines Norte, Philippines on the St Cajetan Saint Page.\n\nRelated Novena\n\nSt Joseph Novena",
