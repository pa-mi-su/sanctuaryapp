Help us to imitate his openness to Your call in our own lives, that we may be as ready to serve You as he was. St. Andrew, you were one of the first people to be called personally by Our Lord. He called you and your brother St. Peter to leave behind your lives as fishermen and to follow Him as Apostles. You followed His call to become “fishers of men.” And you remained faithful to that call, staying with Him throughout His ministry and spreading the Gospel after His death. You probably never would have guessed that you would be invited to be one of the closest friends of the Son of God, but you left everything behind in order to follow Him. Pray for me, that I may be as ready to serve Christ as you were.

He was the son of Jonah (or John) and the brother of Simon, who would later become St. Peter, the first Pope.\n\nBethsaida was a modest fishing community where families made their living from the abundant fish in the Sea of Galilee. From his youth, Andrew learned the demanding trade of fishing - mending nets, navigating boats, reading the weather and water, and enduring long nights of labor. This work required patience, persistence, and cooperation with others.\n\nAndrew and his brother Simon worked together as fishermen, likely in partnership with Zebedee and his sons James and John. The Gospels describe them as having boats and hired servants, suggesting they were moderately successful in their trade.\n\nBut despite having a stable livelihood and family business, Andrew’s heart yearned for something more. He was among the devout Jews who eagerly awaited the coming of the Messiah promised by the prophets. This spiritual hunger would soon lead him to an encounter that would change his life forever.\n\nDisciple of John the Baptist\n\nBefore meeting Jesus, Andrew became a follower of St. John the Baptist, the great prophet who appeared in the wilderness of Judea preaching repentance and baptizing in the Jordan River.\n\nJohn the Baptist was an extraordinary figure - dressed in camel’s hair, eating locusts and wild honey, fearlessly proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at hand. He called people to turn from their sins and prepare for the coming of the Lord. His preaching was powerful, and crowds from all over Judea came to hear him and be baptized.\n\nAndrew was drawn to John’s message. He left his fishing business in Galilee and traveled to the Jordan River to become one of John’s disciples. This shows Andrew’s spiritual sensitivity and his willingness to leave comfort and security in pursuit of God.\n\nAs a disciple of John, Andrew learned about repentance, prayer, fasting, and watching for the Messiah. John repeatedly told his followers that he was not the Christ, but that one greater than he was coming - one whose sandals he was not worthy to untie.\n\n“Behold, the Lamb of God”\n\nThe pivotal moment of Andrew’s life came one day when he was standing with John the Baptist and another disciple (likely John the Evangelist, though he modestly doesn’t name himself in his Gospel).\n\nJesus walked by, and John the Baptist looked at Him and declared: “Behold, the Lamb of God!” (John 1:36)\n\nThese words electrified Andrew. The “Lamb of God” was a profound title, evoking the Passover lamb whose blood had saved Israel from death in Egypt, and the suffering servant described by Isaiah who would be “led like a lamb to the slaughter” to take away the sins of the world.\n\nWithout hesitation, Andrew and the other disciple left John and began to follow Jesus. Jesus turned and saw them following and asked, “What are you seeking?”\n\nThey answered, “Rabbi, where are you staying?”\n\nJesus replied with a simple but momentous invitation: “Come and see.”\n\nThe First Day with Jesus\n\nAndrew and John went with Jesus and spent the rest of that day with Him. St. John, recalling this momentous encounter decades later when writing his Gospel, even remembered the exact time: “It was about the tenth hour” - around four in the afternoon.\n\nWhat did they discuss during those hours? The Gospel doesn’t tell us, but we can imagine Jesus speaking to them about the kingdom of God, about the Scriptures, about the Father’s love. Perhaps He began to reveal to them who He truly was.\n\nThose hours with Jesus transformed Andrew completely. He went from being a curious seeker to a convinced believer. He became certain that this Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, the one promised by the prophets, the one all Israel had been waiting for.\n\n“We Have Found the Messiah”\n\nThe next thing Andrew did shows the generous, evangelistic spirit that would characterize his entire apostolic life.\n\nHe immediately went to find his brother Simon. The Gospel records Andrew’s excited words: “We have found the Messiah!” (John 1:41)\n\nThis makes Andrew the very first missionary in Christian history - the first person to bring someone else to Christ. Even before Jesus officially began His public ministry, even before the other Apostles were called, Andrew was evangelizing, sharing the Good News.\n\nAndrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at Simon and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter, or Rock). In that moment, Jesus gave Simon the new name that signified his future role as the Rock on which Christ would build His Church.\n\nThis encounter was Andrew’s gift to his brother, to the Church, and to the world. Without Andrew’s evangelization, would Simon Peter have met Jesus? We can never know, but we do know that Andrew’s eager sharing of his faith brought the future first Pope to Christ.\n\nCalled to Be a Fisher of Men\n\nSome time later, after Jesus had begun His public ministry, He was walking by the Sea of Galilee and saw Andrew and Simon casting their nets into the sea. He called out to them:\n\n“Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” (Matthew 4:19)\n\nImmediately - the Gospel emphasizes their instant response - they left their nets and followed Him.\n\nThis was not just a temporary following like Andrew’s earlier encounter. This was a permanent call to leave everything behind and become Jesus’ constant companions and students. They left their fishing business, their livelihood, their old life, everything.\n\nJesus was calling them to a new kind of fishing - not for fish, but for souls. The patience, persistence, and hard work they had learned as fishermen would now be directed toward the infinitely more important work of bringing people into the kingdom of God.\n\nAmong the Twelve Apostles\n\nAndrew was among the privileged twelve men Jesus chose to be His Apostles - His “sent ones” who would be His closest companions during His earthly ministry and would be sent out to preach the Gospel after His resurrection.\n\nIn the lists of the Apostles given in the Gospels, Andrew is always mentioned among the first four, along with his brother Peter and the brothers James and John. These four fishermen from Galilee formed the core of Jesus’ apostolic band.\n\nAndrew witnessed Jesus’ public ministry:\n\nHe saw Jesus perform miracles: healing the sick, casting out demons, calming storms, raising the deadHe heard Jesus teach the crowds and received private instructionHe watched Jesus pray and learned from His exampleHe witnessed Jesus’ compassion for the suffering and the outcast\n\nAndrew’s Role in the Gospels\n\nThough Andrew doesn’t feature as prominently in the Gospel narratives as his brother Peter or as John and James, there are several significant moments when he plays a key role:\n\nThe Feeding of the Five Thousand: When Jesus asked the Apostles how they would feed the massive crowd that had gathered to hear Him, it was Andrew who found the boy with five barley loaves and two fish. Andrew brought the boy to Jesus, though he added skeptically, “But what are they among so many?” Jesus then multiplied these loaves and fish to feed the entire crowd of five thousand men, plus women and children - one of His greatest miracles. Andrew’s practical action of finding the little food available made this miracle possible.\n\nThe Greeks Who Sought Jesus: During Jesus’ final week in Jerusalem, some Greeks (Gentiles who were interested in Judaism) approached Philip and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” Philip went and told Andrew, and together Andrew and Philip told Jesus. This incident is significant because it shows Andrew as a bridge-builder, someone approachable to outsiders, willing to bring Gentiles to Jesus. It foreshadowed the universal mission of the Church to all nations.\n\nThe Mount of Olives Discourse: When Jesus was teaching about the destruction of the Temple and the end times, it was Peter, James, John, and Andrew who privately asked Him when these things would happen. Andrew was thus among the four who received Jesus’ extended teaching about the signs of the end and the need for watchfulness.\n\nAt the Last Supper and the Passion\n\nAs one of the Twelve, Andrew was present at the Last Supper, where Jesus instituted the Eucharist, giving the Apostles (and through them, the Church) His own Body and Blood under the appearances of bread and wine.\n\nAndrew received Holy Communion for the first time directly from the hands of Christ Himself. He witnessed Jesus wash the feet of the Apostles, demonstrating that greatness in the kingdom of God comes through humble service.\n\nWhen Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Gospels tell us that “all the disciples deserted him and fled.” This included Andrew. Like the others, he failed the test of that terrible night, abandoning Jesus in His hour of greatest need.\n\nWe can only imagine Andrew’s anguish during Jesus’ trial, crucifixion, and death. The man he had recognized as the Messiah, the one he had followed and believed in, was brutally executed as a criminal.\n\nThe Resurrection and Pentecost\n\nBut Andrew’s story didn’t end with Jesus’ death. On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead. The Gospels record that the risen Jesus appeared to the Apostles multiple times, showing them that He was truly alive, eating with them, teaching them, preparing them for their mission.\n\nAndrew saw the risen Lord. His faith, shaken by the crucifixion, was restored and strengthened. He understood now that Jesus’ death was not a defeat but a victory - the sacrifice of the true Lamb of God that took away the sins of the world.\n\nBefore His Ascension, Jesus commissioned the Apostles: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28:19-20)\n\nAfter Jesus ascended to Heaven, the Apostles returned to Jerusalem and devoted themselves to prayer, along with Mary the Mother of Jesus and other disciples. Andrew was among them in the Upper Room when the Holy Spirit descended on Pentecost, filling them with power and courage to preach the Gospel.\n\nAndrew’s Missionary Work\n\nAfter Pentecost, according to ancient tradition, Andrew became a great missionary for Christ. While the historical details of his journeys are less certain than those of St. Paul (who wrote letters that survived), early Church traditions agree that Andrew traveled extensively to preach the Gospel.\n\nThe primary regions associated with Andrew’s missionary work include:\n\nScythia: The lands north of the Black Sea, in what is now Ukraine and southern Russia. Byzantine tradition holds that Andrew traveled as far as Kiev and even to the location of future Novgorod.\n\nGreece: Particularly Achaia in southern Greece, where the city of Patras is located. This is where Andrew would eventually be martyred.\n\nAsia Minor: Various regions of modern-day Turkey.\n\nThrace: The region around modern-day European Turkey, Bulgaria, and northern Greece.\n\nEverywhere he went, Andrew preached about Jesus Christ - His life, death, resurrection, and the salvation He offers. He baptized converts, established Christian communities, and ordained leaders for these new churches.\n\nThe work was dangerous. Christians were often persecuted, seen as a threat to both Jewish religious authorities and Roman political power. But Andrew continued faithfully, remembering Jesus’ words: “If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”\n\nMartyrdom at Patras\n\nAccording to early Christian tradition, Andrew’s missionary journeys eventually brought him to Patras, a city in Achaia (southern Greece), around the year 60 AD.\n\nIn Patras, Andrew performed many miracles and converted many people to Christianity, including members of noble families. His preaching was powerful, his life was holy, and God confirmed his message with signs and wonders.\n\nAmong those converted was Maximilla, the wife of the Roman proconsul Aegeas (or Aegeates). Her conversion and her subsequent decision to live in Christian continence enraged her husband.\n\nProconsul Aegeas ordered Andrew to stop preaching about Christ and to offer sacrifice to the Roman gods. When Andrew refused, boldly proclaiming that Jesus Christ was the only true God, Aegeas had him arrested and tortured.\n\nAndrew was scourged brutally, but he praised God through his suffering. Finally, Aegeas sentenced him to death by crucifixion.\n\nThe X-Shaped Cross\n\nLike his brother Peter, Andrew did not feel worthy to die in exactly the same manner as Jesus. When Peter was crucified in Rome, he asked to be crucified upside down. Andrew requested a different cross.\n\nTradition holds that Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross, now known as a St. Andrew’s Cross or saltire. He was tied (not nailed, according to some accounts) to the cross so that his suffering would be prolonged.\n\nAndrew remained alive on the cross for two days, and during this entire time, he preached to the crowds who gathered. He proclaimed the Gospel, urged them to remain faithful to Christ, and explained the meaning of Jesus’ death and resurrection.\n\nHis final words, according to tradition, were addressed to the cross itself:\n\n“Hail, precious Cross! You have been consecated by the body of my Lord and adorned with his limbs as rich jewels. I come to you exulting and glad; receive me with joy into your arms. O good Cross, you have received beauty from our Lord’s limbs. I have ardently loved you; long have I desired and sought you. Now you are found by me, and you are made ready for my longing soul. Receive me into your arms, take me from among men, and present me to my Master, so that he who redeemed me on you may receive me by you.”\n\nAndrew died on his cross, giving his life for Christ as a martyr. His body was buried in Patras, where his tomb became a site of pilgrimage.\n\nThe Spread of Andrew’s Relics and Cult\n\nAfter Andrew’s martyrdom, veneration of him spread throughout the Christian world:\n\nConstantinople: In 357 AD, Andrew’s relics were transferred to the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. This increased devotion to him throughout the East.\n\nScotland: Andrew became the patron saint of Scotland. Legend holds that in the 9th century, some of Andrew’s relics were brought to Scotland, to the place now called St. Andrews. The X-shaped cross became Scotland’s flag.\n\nRussia: Because of the tradition that Andrew evangelized the lands that would become Russia, he is venerated as the first preacher of Christianity in that region and is a patron saint of Russia.\n\nAmalfi, Italy: In 1208, during the Crusades, Andrew’s relics were moved from Constantinople to Amalfi in southern Italy, where they remain in the Cathedral of St. Andrew.\n\nPatras, Greece: In 1964, Pope Paul VI returned a portion of Andrew’s relics to Patras as a gesture of goodwill between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. They are enshrined in the Church of St. Andrew in Patras, near where he was martyred.\n\nPatron Saint\n\nSt. Andrew is the patron saint of:\n\nScotland: The St. Andrew’s Cross (X-shaped, white on blue) is Scotland’s flagRussia: Due to traditions of his missionary work in ScythiaGreece: Especially Patras, where he was martyredFishermen: His original professionSingers: For his preaching and praise of God during his martyrdomUnmarried women: Due to medieval traditions\n\nLessons from St. Andrew’s Life\n\nSt. Andrew’s life offers profound lessons for all Christians:\n\n1. Immediate Response to Christ’s Call: When Andrew first encountered Jesus and later when Jesus called him to full discipleship, he responded immediately. He didn’t delay, make excuses, or wait for a more convenient time. His example challenges us to respond promptly when God calls us.\n\n2. Evangelistic Zeal: Andrew’s first impulse after meeting Jesus was to bring his brother Simon to Christ. This shows us that authentic encounter with Jesus naturally overflows into sharing Him with others. Evangelization isn’t just for priests and religious - it’s for every Christian.\n\n3. The Apostolate of Introduction: Andrew didn’t just preach to crowds; he brought individuals to Jesus personally - his brother Peter, the boy with the loaves and fish, the Greeks seeking Jesus. Sometimes our most important work is simply introducing people to Christ and letting Jesus take it from there.\n\n4. Humble Service: Though Andrew was the first Apostle called and brought Peter to Christ, he never sought prominence. He served faithfully in the background while his brother Peter became the leader. This shows beautiful humility and freedom from ambition.\n\n5. Faithfulness unto Death: Andrew remained faithful to Christ even when it cost him everything - comfort, security, and ultimately his life. His martyrdom reminds us that following Christ may require the ultimate sacrifice, and that Heaven is worth any cost.\n\n6. Joy in Suffering: Andrew’s words to the cross show that he embraced his martyrdom not with resignation but with joy, seeing it as the ultimate way to be united to Christ. This transforms our understanding of Christian suffering.\n\nConclusion: The First-Called, Forever Faithful\n\nSt. Andrew holds a unique place in Christian history as the “first-called” - the first person recorded in the Gospels as following Jesus, the first to evangelize (bringing Peter to Christ), the first in a long line of missionaries who would bring the Gospel to the ends of the earth.\n\nHis life models for us what it means to truly be a disciple of Jesus: immediate response to God’s call, zealous sharing of faith with others, humble service without seeking recognition, and faithfulness unto death.\n\nAs we pray this novena to St. Andrew, we ask for his intercession to help us follow Christ with the same enthusiasm, generosity, and courage that characterized his life. May we, like Andrew, be ready to leave everything to follow Jesus, eager to bring others to Him, and faithful to the end.\n\nSt. Andrew the Apostle, first-called disciple of Christ, pray for us!",
