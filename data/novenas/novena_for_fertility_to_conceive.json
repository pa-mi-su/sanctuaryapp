These couples are called to be fruitful and love in other ways in their lives.\n\nBut God also, through prayer, has healed infertility in many couples and enabled them to conceive. Examples in Scripture include Abraham and Sarah, Hannah the mother of Samuel, Sts. Elizabeth and Zechariah (parents of St John the Baptist), and in Catholic Tradition, Sts. Joachim and Anne, the parents of Our Lady.\n\nIn this novena, we ask the intercession of many saints known to help couples conceive, including the Virgin Mary, St Gerard Majella, Sts Joachim and Anne, St Collette, and St Raphael.",
