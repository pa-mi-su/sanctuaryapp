At the time of this email, I am not fully cured, but she did help me know the ways to make and use it. Which are seeing people as people (God’s perfection), not as objectives, but also seeing the joys of God (not letting the sadness block the light of the Lord), more and more doing these rosaries, she showed me that.\n\nBut I have to give thanks to other saints that helped, and I asked for help like St Jude, St. John Paul 2, St Therese, St. Joseph and the three archangels. Please, if you or someone you know is struggling, ask for the Holy Mother’s help, but also remind the gifts that God has blessed us throughout the day, but also that you do not need those things. But do not lose hope, be very patient with God; it takes time, but it’s very rewarding.\n\nfrom Anonymous\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the The 54 Day Rosary Novena\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nRelated Novena\n\nSt Gabriel the Archangel Novena",
