This devotion originated in the 13th century with St. Francis of Assisi, who had a deep devotion to St. Michael the Archangel and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pray this novena to grow closer to God, to Our Lady, and to St. Michael.\n\nSt. Francis would retreat to Mount La Verna for this period of spiritual discipline, seeking to honor both Mary and St. Michael while deepening his contemplation of Christ’s Passion. Notably, during St. Michael’s Lent in 1224, St. Francis received the stigmata, the wounds of Christ, around the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14).\n\nThe practice became popular among Franciscans and spread to some lay Catholics, particularly in the Middle Ages, when devotion to St. Michael was widespread, and his feast, Michaelmas, was a major holy day.\n\nSt. Michael’s Lent was seen as a mini-Lent, mirroring the structure of the pre-Easter Lent but less rigorous, focusing on spiritual renewal and preparation for Michaelmas.\n\nHowever, it was never an official liturgical season and gradually fell out of common practice after the 18th century, possibly due to shifts in Church customs, the Protestant Reformation, and the rise of secular society, which diminished extended devotional fasts.\n\nIn recent times, St. Michael’s Lent has made a comeback and is gaining in popularity.\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the St Michael's Lent Novena\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nRelated Novena\n\nSt Joseph Novena",
