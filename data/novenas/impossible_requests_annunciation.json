She answered one of my prayers the same. I had prayed for her to soften the heart of a specific person who was not cooperating (she had every reason to). That same day that persons heart softened through the power of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the person decided to help me.\n\nfrom N.G.\n\nI started the novena back in January of this year and have prayed it in anticipation for the Annunciation Novena.\n\nOur adult daughter, who for many years has been away from the faith, on Ash Wednesday, sent us a text asking if there were such a thing as ‘virtual ashes’ she could receive since she couldn’t make it to Mass.\n\nFrom that point on, she has shared scripture verses via text messages and is now taking steps to return to the Eucharist. Indeed, how good is the LORD.\n\nA M D G… For the greater glory of God.\n\nfrom D.B.\n\nI am writing to share a testimony of how the Annunciation Impossible Requests 9 Month Novena has already begun to bring about an answered prayer in my life.\n\nThough I am still in the process of completing the novena, I am deeply grateful to share that my family and I have already received a significant answer to our prayers. For several months, we have been waiting for the approval of my work permit and my daughter’s study permit. This situation had left us feeling anxious, as the outcome had a direct impact on our future plans.\n\nIn faith, I included these requests in my novena, and to our great joy, we have already received the approval for both my work permit and my daughter’s study permit. In addition, my daughter’s tuition fees have been reduced from international to domestic rates, a blessing that has lifted a tremendous financial burden from us.\n\nI truly believe this is the hand of God at work, and I am so grateful for the intercession of Our Blessed Mother, who has guided us and helped us in this time of need. Even though I have not yet completed the full novena, I wanted to share this early answer to prayer as a testimony of God’s faithfulness and love.\n\nI will continue to pray the novena and also want to thank you for this wonderful novena app. It has been a great blessing to many people, including myself, by serving as a guide in praying the novena. May God continue to bless you abundantly.\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\n\nfrom M.C.\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the Annunciation Impossible Requests 9 Month Novena\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nRelated Novena\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe Novena\n\nWhat is the 9 month novena for impossible requests?\n\nIn the Impossible Requests Novena, you list three difficult, seemingly hopeless, or otherwise impossible requests and pray for each one of them within the novena prayers each day.\n\nWe believe in faith that nothing is impossible to God and that Our Lady’s intercession is more powerful than anyone else’s, so we believe that, if it is God’s will for us, He will answer our prayers in this novena in the way that we hope.\n\nIf our prayers seem to be unanswered, we resign ourselves to God’s will and know that it is best for us that we did not receive the answer that we wanted. God’s ways are higher than our ways, and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.\n\nTo accompany this novena, it is a good and pious practice to assist at Mass and go to Confession on the 25th of each month from March to December.",
