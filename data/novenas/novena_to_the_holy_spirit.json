With His sevenfold gifts He enlightens the mind, strengthens the will, and inflames the heart with love of God. To ensure our salvation we ought to invoke the Divine Spirit daily, for The Spirit helpeth our infirmity. We know not what we should pray for as we ought. But the Spirit Himself asketh for us. Almighty and eternal God, Who hast vouchsafed to regenerate us by water and the Holy Spirit, and hast given us forgiveness all sins, vouchsafe to send forth from heaven upon us your sevenfold Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and fortitude, the Spirit of Knowledge and Piety, and fill us with the Spirit of Holy Fear.

Light Divine! Visit Thou these hearts of Thine, And our inmost being fill! The gift of Knowledge enables the soul to evaluate created things at their true worth–in their relation to God.

It shows us the loving care of God even in adversity, and directs us to glorify Him in every circumstance of life. Guided by its light, we put first things first, and prize the friendship of God beyond all else. Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it.

This miracle showed that God was reversing the curse from the Tower of Babel, where He confused the people’s tongues so they could not understand each other.\n\nPray the novena to the Holy Spirit for an increase in His seven gifts in your life.",
