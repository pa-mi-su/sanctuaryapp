Amen.\n\nSaint Maria Goretti who, strengthened by God’s grace, did not hesitate, even at a young age, to shed your blood and sacrifice life itself to defend your virginal purity, look graciously on the unhappy human race, which has strayed far from the path of eternal salvation. Teach us all, and especially youth, with what courage and promptitude we should flee for the love of Jesus, anything that could offend Him or stain our souls with sin. Obtain for us from our Lord victory in temptation, comfort in the sorrows of life, and the grace which we earnestly beg of Thee, (mention request here…) and may we one day enjoy with Thee the imperishable glory of heaven. Amen.\n\nMost lovable little Saint, who valued your purity above any earthly gain, and who sealed this choice with a martyr’s death, obtain for me also a strong love of this virtue, so consoling to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The pleasures of the world create many temptations for me. I turn to your powerful intercession in Heaven, so that with this help I may remain ever loyal to God, no matter what the price. In danger inspire me to repeat with you, No, it is a sin!\n\nPray the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary Lord, have mercy on us Christ, have mercy on us Lord, have mercy on us Christ, hear us Christ, graciously hear us God the Father of heaven, have mercy on us.

Your great love of the Sacred Hearts made all this possible. Teach me to love Jesus and His Blessed Mother, so that I too will be inspired to daily self-denial. I am inclined to pamper myself, to gratify my senses, and to excuse myself from all penance. This keeps me from being a true follower of Christ.

He, while hanging upon His Cross of Suffering, uttered through parched lips, Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.

Grant me the grace, O Heroic Saint, to be charitable to others. Much of my time is spent on vengeful thoughts, seeking how I may pay back to others the harm they have done to me.

Knowing she would be alone, he returned to the house and threatened her with a knife if she did not do what he said; he was intending to rape her. She would not submit, however, protesting that what he wanted to do was a mortal sin and warning him that he would go to Hell.\n\nShe fought desperately, and he stabbed her numerous times.\n\nThe following day, Maria forgave Alessandro and said that she wanted to have him in Heaven with her, then she died of her injuries.\n\nAlessandro was captured and sentenced to to 30 years in prison.\n\nA bishop, Monsignor Giovanni Blandini, visited him in jail. He wrote a thank you note to the Bishop asking for his prayers and telling him about a dream, “in which Maria gave him lilies, which burned immediately in his hands.”\n\nAfter his release, Alessandro visited Maria’s mother and begged her forgiveness. She forgave him, saying that if Maria had forgiven him on her death bed then she could not do less, and they attended Mass together the next day, receiving Holy Communion side by side.\n\nHe reportedly prayed to her every day and referred to her as “my little saint.” He attended her canonization in 1950.\n\nAlessandro later became a lay brother of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, living in a monastery and working as its receptionist and gardener until he died peacefully in 1970 at age 87.\n\nSt. Maria Goretti is the patron saint of chastity, rape victims, girls, youth, teenage girls, poverty, purity and forgiveness.",
