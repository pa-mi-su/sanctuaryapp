Amen.\n\nJesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion. Glory Be x3 Litany of supplications in honor of St. Joseph’s hidden life with Jesus and Mary: St. Joseph, pray that Jesus may come into our souls and sanctify us.

St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the wisdom of faith. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus His blessing of perseverance in our good deeds. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the strength to carry our crosses. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus a disdain for the material goods of this world. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the grace to always walk on the narrow path toward Heaven. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the grace to avoid all occasions of sin. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus a holy desire for eternal bliss. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the grace of final perseverance. St. Joseph, do not abandon us. St. Joseph, pray that our hearts may never cease to love you and that our lips may ever praise you. St. Joseph, for the love you did bear for Jesus, grant that we may learn to love Him. St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II. Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon us and watch over us; lead us on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which we now beg you to envelop within the folds of your fatherly cloak. Dismiss those obstacles and difficulties standing in the way of our prayers and grant that the happy answer to our petition may serve for the greater glory of God and our eternal salvation. As a pledge of our undying gratitude, we promise to spread the word of your glory while offering thanks to the Lord for having so blessed your power and might in Heaven and on earth.

Amen. Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus a holy desire for eternal bliss. St. Joseph, request for us from Jesus the grace of final perseverance. St. Joseph, do not abandon us. St. Joseph, pray that our hearts may never cease to love you and that our lips may ever praise you. St. Joseph, for the love you did bear for Jesus, grant that we may learn to love Him. St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II. Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon us and watch over us; lead us on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which we now beg you to envelop within the folds of your fatherly cloak. Dismiss those obstacles and difficulties standing in the way of our prayers and grant that the happy answer to our petition may serve for the greater glory of God and our eternal salvation.

Amen. Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen.

By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven.

Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II.

From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse.

Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-6:hover, #share-native-6:hover, #share-copy-6:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '6'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/holy-cloak-of-st-joseph-novena-30-days/'; var pageTitle = \"Holy Cloak of St Joseph Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();",

Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II.

O God, in Your ineffable providence You were pleased to choose Blessed Joseph to be the spouse of Your most holy Mother; grant, we beg You, that we may be worthy to have him for our intercessor in heaven whom on earth we venerate as our Protector: You who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided.

From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Amen. Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

O God, in Your ineffable providence You were pleased to choose Blessed Joseph to be the spouse of Your most holy Mother; grant, we beg You, that we may be worthy to have him for our intercessor in heaven whom on earth we venerate as our Protector: You who live and reign forever and ever. Amen. Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided.

Amen. II.

Saint Joseph, pray for us.\n\nClosing Prayer of the Holy Cloak O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, you who were chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, we beseech you to accept us within the folds of your holy cloak, that you may become the guardian and custodian of our souls. From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.

Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.

Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary. By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II.

By that sacred bond of devotion which linked you to the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, and by the fatherly love you lavished on the Child Jesus, we beg you to cast a glance on those heavenly gifts which the Divine Redeemer has obtained for all mankind through His Precious Blood, and through your power and mercy, help us in our needs. O holy protector of the Holy Family, protect us children of the Lord Jesus Christ; keep far from us the errors and evils which corrupt the world; assist us from Heaven in our struggles against the powers of darkness. And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II.

And as you once did protect the Divine Child from the cruel edict of Herod, now defend the Church and keep it safe from all dangers and threats; spread over all of us your holy patronage so that by following your example and aided by your spiritual guidance, we may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in Heaven.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II. Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon us and watch over us; lead us on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which we now beg you to envelop within the folds of your fatherly cloak.

From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II. Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon us and watch over us; lead us on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which we now beg you to envelop within the folds of your fatherly cloak. Dismiss those obstacles and difficulties standing in the way of our prayers and grant that the happy answer to our petition may serve for the greater glory of God and our eternal salvation.

From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Pray the Glory Be 3 times in thanksgiving to God for having exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity. Offering O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, we humbly prostrate ourselves before you. We beg the Lord Jesus, your Immaculate Spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court to join us in this devotion. We offer you this precious cloak while pledging our sincerest faith and devotion. We promise to do all in our power to honor you throughout our lifetime to prove our love for you. Help us, St. Joseph. Assist us now and throughout our lifetimes, but especially at the moment of our deaths, as you were assisted by Jesus and Mary, that we may join you one day in Heaven and there honor you for all eternity. Amen. O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate before you and your Divine Son Jesus, we offer you with heartfelt devotion this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned your sacred person. In you, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of your precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for your presence on this earth. In fact, not only were you surrounded by the shining splendor of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but you were splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favorite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honored you with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring us, your devoted servants, to present you with this precious cloak in your honor. Grant, O great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward us. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, we beseech you, O Glorious Patriarch, through your intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon us in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number us among your devoted servants who live serenely under the patronage of your Holy Cloak. Grant that we may live always within the protection of this patronage every day of our lives and particularly at that moment when we draw our dying breath. Prayers I. Hail, O Glorious St. Joseph, you who are entrusted with the priceless treasures of Heaven and earth and foster-father of Him who nourishes all the creatures of the universe. You are, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. You alone, above all the Saints, were chosen for that supreme honor of rearing, guiding, nourishing, and even embracing the Messiah, whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold. St. Joseph, save our souls and obtain for us from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which we humbly pray. And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Glory Be x3 II. O powerful St. Joseph, you were proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church; therefore, we invoke you, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and we offer countless blessings to your most generous heart, always ready to help in any need. To you, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache, or anguish which you have not consoled. Deign, we beseech you, to use on our behalf those gifts which God has given you, until we, too, shall be granted the answer to our petition. And you, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for us. Glory Be x3 III. Countless are those who have prayed to you before us and have received comfort and peace, graces and favors. Our hearts, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets us. O Glorious St. Joseph, you know all our needs even before we set them forth in prayer. You know how important this petition is for us. We prostrate ourselves before you as we sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts us. There is no human heart in which we can confide our sorrow; and even if we should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist us, still he would be unable to help us. Only you can help us in our sorrow, St. Joseph, and we beg you to hear our plea. (mention request here…) Has not St. Teresa left it written in her Dialogues that the world may always know, Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive? O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on our sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in you. Glory Be x3 IV. O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of your perfect obedience to God, you may intercede for us. For your holy life full of grace and merit, hear our prayer. For your most sweet name, help us. For your most holy tears, comfort us. For your seven sorrows, intercede for us. For your seven joys, console us. From all harm of body and soul, deliver us. From all danger and disaster, save us. Assist us with your powerful intercession and seek for us, through your power and mercy, all that is necessary for our salvation and particularly the favor of which we now stand in such great need. Glory Be x3 V. O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favors which you have obtained for afflicted souls. Those who suffer illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread—all who implore your powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction. Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that we alone be the only ones of all who have appealed to you, to be denied this petition which we so earnestly beg of you. Show your kindness and generosity even to us, that we may cry out in thanksgiving, Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, our great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. Glory Be x3 VI. Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, we beg You to grant our petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary we prostrate ourselves before Your Divine Presence and we beseech You to accept our hopeful plea to persevere in our prayers that we may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph. Extend Your blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which we today offer to him as a pledge of our devotion.

St. Joseph, graciously accept us as your devoted servants. St. Joseph, we give ourselves to you; accept our pleas and hear our prayers. St. Joseph, do not abandon us at the hour of our death. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, we give you our hearts and our souls. Glory Be x3 Invocations I. Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to your protection and sought your intercession was left unaided. Confidently we prostrate ourselves before you and fervently beg for your powerful intervention. O foster-father of our dear Redeemer, despise not our petition, but in your mercy hear and answer us. Amen. II. Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon us and watch over us; lead us on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which we now beg you to envelop within the folds of your fatherly cloak. Dismiss those obstacles and difficulties standing in the way of our prayers and grant that the happy answer to our petition may serve for the greater glory of God and our eternal salvation.

From this moment on, we choose you as our father, our protector, our counselor, our patron; and we beseech you to place in your custody our bodies, our souls, all that we are, all that we possess, our lives and our deaths. Look upon us as your children; defend us from the treachery of our enemies, invisible or otherwise; assist us at all times in all our necessities; console us in the bitterness of our lives, and especially at the hour of our deaths. Say but one word for us to the Divine Redeemer whom you were deemed worthy to hold in your arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, your most chaste spouse. Request for us those blessings that will lead us to salvation. Include us among those who are most dear to you and we shall set forth to prove ourselves worthy of your special patronage. Amen. Prayer to St Joseph To you do we cry in our tribulations, O Blessed Saint Joseph, as we confidently invoke your patronage, after that of your most holy spouse the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-30:hover, #share-native-30:hover, #share-copy-30:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '30'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/holy-cloak-of-st-joseph-novena-30-days/'; var pageTitle = \"Holy Cloak of St Joseph Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();\n\nEmail Me Answered Prayers\n\nSend me your answered prayers from the Holy Cloak of St. Joseph Novena 30 Days\n\n⏰ Reminder Signup\n\nClick here to get the Catholic Novena Ebook for FREE, as well as reminders of when novenas begin\n\nRelated Novena\n\nSt Joseph Novena",
