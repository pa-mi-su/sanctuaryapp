Look upon my family in Your loving kindness, preserve us from danger, give us help in time of need, and grant us the grace to persevere to the end in imitation of Your holy Family, so that having revered You and loved You faithfully on earth, we may praise You eternally in heaven. Mary, dearest Mother, to your intercession we have recourse, knowing that your Divine Son will hear your prayers. Glorious patriarch, Saint Joseph, help us by your powerful prayers and offer our prayers to Jesus through Mary’s hands. Amen.\n\nLord Jesus Christ, being subject to Mary and Joseph, You sanctified family life by Your beautiful virtues. Grant that we, with the help of Mary and Joseph, may be taught by the example of Your holy Family, and may after death enjoy its everlasting companionship. Lord Jesus, help us ever to follow the example of Your holy Family, that in the hour of our death Your glorious Virgin Mother together with Saint Joseph may come to meet us, and we may be worthy to be received by You into the everlasting joys of heaven.

Of course, we have the infancy narratives, a small section of his childhood as revealed in the flight to Egypt, and years later the finding of the child Jesus in the Temple, but otherwise we know little about their life.\n\nUnfortunately, the depictions of Mary and Joseph in popular culture — including well-meaning movies and Contemporary Christian music — usually at best miss the mark, and at worst are heretical and demeaning to Our Lady. Occasionally there is a good depiction that recognizes their exceedingly great sanctity.\n\nOver the centuries, God has granted private revelation to several faithful men and women about the hidden life of Jesus and the Holy Family, all of which reveal the tremendous love and virtue lived out in their life together, but none of these writings are binding upon the Faithful to accept, since they are not public revelation.\n\nBut even with relatively little to go on, we as Catholics can greatly benefit from meditating upon the life of the Holy Family and from calling upon them in prayer — a favorite is “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph: assist me!”\n\n(Credit for this novena goes to ewtn.com)",
