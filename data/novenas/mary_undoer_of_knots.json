I entrust to You today this knot….and all the negative consequences that it provokes in my life. I give you this knot that torments me and makes me unhappy and so impedes me from uniting myself to You and Your Son Jesus, my Savior. I run to You, Mary, Undoer of Knots because I trust you and I know that you never despise a sinning child who comes to ask you for help. I believe that you can undo this knot because Jesus grants you everything. I believe that you want to undo this knot because you are my Mother. I believe that You will do this because you love me with eternal love. Thank you, Dear Mother. Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. The one who seeks grace, finds it in Mary’s hands.\n\nSay the last 2 decades of the rosary Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exists in your heart, cast your compassionate eyes upon me and see the snarl of knots that exist in my life. You know very well how desperate I am, my pain and how I am bound by these knots.

Keep me, guide me, protect me, o safe refuge! Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.’\n\nIn the Bible, St. Paul contrasted the disobedience of Adam with the obedience of Christ, the New Adam. Similarly, St. Irenaeus in his seminal work, Against Heresies, portrayed the parallel between Eve’s disobedience and the Virgin Mary’s faithful obedience, through which the knot of sin and death was undone.\n\nThis novena has grown in popularity over the past several centuries, most recently with Pope Francis’s devotion to it.\n\nLet’s look at how this unique devotion developed.\n\nJohann Melchior Georg Schmittdner (1625-1707) painted the famous Baroque image of Mary Undoer of Knots with great grace. In the painting, our Lady is holding a ribbon and untying knots in it. She is in Heaven, surrounded by angels, and stands on a crescent moon while crushing the head of the serpent (the devil). The Holy Spirit, through the image of a dove, flies above her head.\n\nThe striking simplicity and beauty of the image is one of the reasons that many are drawn to this devotion. Beginning in 1700 AD, the image has been venerated in the Church of St. Peter in Perlach (Augsburg, Germany).\n\nThe Knots in Our Lives\n\nWe each have knots in our life: emotional wounds, fractured relationships, deaths of loved ones, personal problems that we cannot overcome, addictions, habitual sins, fears, sickness, and so many more.\n\nThese knots build up over time and can lead us to feel helpless, powerless, and hopeless about ever overcoming them.\n\nThis is where Mary Undoer of Knots comes in, to pray for us as only she can, with intercession that is unfailing, so that our Lord can heal us from these knots. Our Lady knows the struggles and pains that we face. She is our Mother, given to us by God, and for her honor and God’s glory she will obtain for us the untying of all our knots, if we but approach her faithfully, believing that God can and will deliver us.\n\nPope Francis Devotes Himself To It\n\nPope Francis, in the 1980s while still a priest, came upon this image while traveling and studying in Germany and was instantly struck by it. He returned to Argentina and began to spread the devotion to those around him there, including after he became Archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Denis and Suzel Frem Bourgerie published a Mary, Undoer of Knots Novena in a pamphlet, which helped educate people about the devotion and title of our Lady.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Campinas granted the couple approval to build a chapel called Mary Gate of Heaven and place a replica of the famous painting in it. The Bourgeries have continued promoting this beautiful devotion to this day.\n\nWith the elevation of Pope Francis to the papacy, the devotion has reached new heights of popularity.",
