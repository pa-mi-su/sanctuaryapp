Amen.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, patron of students and Catholic schools, I thank God for the gifts of light and knowledge he bestowed on you, which you used to build up the Church in love. I thank God, too, for the wealth and richness of theological teaching you left in your writings. Not only were you a great teacher, you lived a life of virtue and you made holiness the desire of your heart. If I cannot imitate you in the brilliance of your academic pursuits, I can follow you in the humility and charity which marked your life. As St. Paul said, charity is the greatest gift, and it is open to all. Pray for me that I might grow in holiness and charity. Pray also for Catholic schools, and for all students. In particular, please obtain the favor I ask during this novena. (mention request here…)\n\nGod Himself is the rule and mode of virtue. Our faith is measured by divine truth, our hope by the greatness of His power and faithful affection, our charity by His goodness. His truth, power and goodness outreach any measure of reason. We can certainly never believe, trust or love God more than, or even as much as, we should. Extravagance is impossible. Here is no virtuous moderation, no measurable mean; the more extreme our activity, the better we are.\n\nCreator of all things, true source of light and wisdom, origin of all being, graciously let a ray of your light penetrate the darkness of my understanding. Take from me the double darkness in which I have been born, an obscurity of sin and ignorance. Give me a keen understanding, a retentive memory, and the ability to grasp things correctly and fundamentally. Grant me the talent of being exact in my explanations and the ability to express myself with thoroughness and charm. Point out the beginning, direct the progress, and help in the completion. I ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-1:hover, #share-native-1:hover, #share-copy-1:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '1'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/st-thomas-aquinas-novena/'; var pageTitle = \"St. Thomas Aquinas Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();\n\n(function() { var dailyCTA = document.getElementById('branch-daily-prayer-1'); if (dailyCTA && typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { var link = dailyCTA.querySelector('a'); if (link) { link.addEventListener('click', function() { var eventData = { event_category: 'conversion', novena: \"St. Thomas Aquinas Novena\", day: '1', novena_slug: 'st-thomas-aquinas-novena', source: 'daily_prayer_cta' }; if (window.abTestDownloadFunnel) { eventData.ab_test = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.testName; eventData.ab_variant = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.variant; } window.trackEvent('daily_prayer_cta_clicked', eventData); }); } } })();",

Therefore he wants the desires of his rational creatures to be fulfilled because they share most perfectly of all creatures the goodness of God.

So it belongs to the divine goodness to fulfill the desires of rational creatures which are put to him in prayer.\n\nCreator of all things, true source of light and wisdom, origin of all being, graciously let a ray of your light penetrate the darkness of my understanding.

If I cannot imitate you in the brilliance of your academic pursuits, I can follow you in the humility and charity which marked your life. As St. Paul said, charity is the greatest gift, and it is open to all. Pray for me that I might grow in holiness and charity. Pray also for Catholic schools, and for all students. In particular, please obtain the favor I ask during this novena. (mention request here…)\n\nFear is such a powerful emotion for humans that when we allow it to take us over, it drives compassion right out of our hearts. We must love them both, those whose opinions we share and those whose opinions we reject, for both have labored in the search for truth, and both have helped us in finding it.\n\nCreator of all things, true source of light and wisdom, origin of all being, graciously let a ray of your light penetrate the darkness of my understanding. Take from me the double darkness in which I have been born, an obscurity of sin and ignorance. Give me a keen understanding, a retentive memory, and the ability to grasp things correctly and fundamentally. Grant me the talent of being exact in my explanations and the ability to express myself with thoroughness and charm. Point out the beginning, direct the progress, and help in the completion. I ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n\n\n#share-facebook-7:hover, #share-native-7:hover, #share-copy-7:hover { background: #f8f6f3 !important; transform: scale(1.05); }\n\n(function() { var day = '7'; var pageUrl = 'https://catholicnovenaapp.com/novenas/st-thomas-aquinas-novena/'; var pageTitle = \"St. Thomas Aquinas Novena\"; var fbBtn = document.getElementById('share-facebook-' + day); var nativeBtn = document.getElementById('share-native-' + day); var copyBtn = document.getElementById('share-copy-' + day); var copyFeedback = document.getElementById('copy-feedback-' + day); function trackShare(platform) { if (typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { window.trackEvent('social_share_clicked', { event_category: 'engagement', novena: pageTitle, day: day, platform: platform, source: 'daily_prayer_share' }); } } if (fbBtn) { fbBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('facebook'); var fbUrl = 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=' + encodeURIComponent(pageUrl) + '&quote=' + encodeURIComponent(pageTitle); var left = (screen.width - 600) / 2; var top = (screen.height - 400) / 2; window.open(fbUrl, 'facebook-share', 'width=600,height=400,left=' + left + ',top=' + top); }); } if (nativeBtn && navigator.share) { nativeBtn.style.display = 'flex'; nativeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('native'); navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: pageUrl }); }); } if (copyBtn) { copyBtn.addEventListener('click', function() { trackShare('copy'); if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) { navigator.clipboard.writeText(pageUrl).then(function() { showCopyFeedback(); }); } else { var textArea = document.createElement('textarea'); textArea.value = pageUrl; textArea.style.position = 'fixed'; textArea.style.left = '-9999px'; document.body.appendChild(textArea); textArea.select(); document.execCommand('copy'); document.body.removeChild(textArea); showCopyFeedback(); } }); } function showCopyFeedback() { if (copyFeedback) { copyFeedback.style.display = 'block'; setTimeout(function() { copyFeedback.style.display = 'none'; }, 2000); } } })();\n\n(function() { var dailyCTA = document.getElementById('branch-daily-prayer-7'); if (dailyCTA && typeof window.trackEvent !== 'undefined') { var link = dailyCTA.querySelector('a'); if (link) { link.addEventListener('click', function() { var eventData = { event_category: 'conversion', novena: \"St. Thomas Aquinas Novena\", day: '7', novena_slug: 'st-thomas-aquinas-novena', source: 'daily_prayer_cta' }; if (window.abTestDownloadFunnel) { eventData.ab_test = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.testName; eventData.ab_variant = window.abTestDownloadFunnel.variant; } window.trackEvent('daily_prayer_cta_clicked', eventData); }); } } })();",

Doubtless, such a person would believe there was a fire in the house, even though they did not see the fire that must be causing all this heat.

He sought to enter the Dominican Order, but his family stopped him for some time by capturing him and holding him in their castle.\n\nDuring that imprisonment, they sent in a prostitute to tempt him to sin, but he drove her out, and angels came to him and Thomas was given a special grace of not being tempted against purity again in his life (for those interested in growing in purity, search for the Angelic Warfare Confraternity established by the Dominicans through the graces given to St. Thomas with regard to purity.)\n\nThomas went on to enter the Dominican Order, become a professor and theologian, writing the Summa Theologiae, the greatest work on faith and reason ever made.\n\nHe is the patron of Catholic colleges and schools and is sought out by students for help in their studies.",
