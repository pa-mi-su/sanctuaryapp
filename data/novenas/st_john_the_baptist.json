O Most Zealous Apostle, who, without working any miracle on others, but solely by the example of your life of penance and the power of your word, did draw after you the multitudes, in order to dispose them to receive the Messiah worthily and to listen to his heavenly doctrine, grant that it may be given unto me, by means of your example of a holy life and the exercise of every good work, to bring many souls to God, but above all to those souls that are enveloped in the darkness of error and ignorance and are led astray by vice. O Martyr Invincible, who, for the honor of God and the salvation of souls, did with firmness and constancy withstand the impiety of Herod even at the cost of your own life, and did rebuke him openly for his wicked and dissolute life, by your prayers obtain for me a heart, brave and generous, in order that I may overcome all human respect and openly profess my faith in loyal obedience to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Pray for me, Saint John the Baptist, that I may be made worthy of the promises of Christ, specifically, (mention request here…) O God, who has made this day to be honorable in our eyes by the commemoration of blessed John the Baptist, grant unto your people the grace of spiritual joy, and direct the minds of all your faithful into the way of everlasting salvation.\n\nOur Father Hail Mary Glory Be St. John the Baptist, pray for us!\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

He gave his life for Christ when Herod Antipas the Tetrarch had him beheaded.\n\nHe is the patron of countless dioceses, cities, and causes.",
