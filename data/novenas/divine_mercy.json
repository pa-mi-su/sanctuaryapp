Amen.\n\n(mention request here…)\n\n“Today bring to Me all mankind, especially all sinners, and immerse them in the ocean of My mercy. In this way you will console Me in the bitter grief into which the loss of souls plunges Me.” Most Merciful Jesus, whose very nature it is to have compassion on us and to forgive us, do not look upon our sins but upon our trust which we place in Your infinite goodness. Receive us all into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart, and never let us escape from It. We beg this of You by Your love which unites You to the Father and the Holy Spirit. Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon all mankind and especially upon poor sinners, all enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. For the sake of His sorrowful Passion show us Your mercy, that we may praise the omnipotence of Your mercy for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nPray the Divine Mercy Chaplet (you can use regular Rosary beads for this):\n\nMake the Sign of the Cross. Pray the Optional Opening Prayers St. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners. O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious Blood. O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have been enough for the salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for us can never be equaled. Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy. God will not deny His mercy to anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but God’s mercy will never be exhausted. Oh, what immense joy burns in my heart when I contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O Jesus! I desire to bring all sinners to Your feet that they may glorify Your mercy throughout endless ages (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 72). You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us. (Repeat three times) O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You! Then on the first beads above the crucifix pray one Our Father one Hail Mary and The Apostles Creed I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended to the dead; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. Using the Rosary beads, on the Our Father Beads say the following: Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Thy dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world. After each Eternal Father prayer, on the ten Hail Mary Beads say the following: For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. (Repeat step 4 and 5 for all five decades). Conclude with the Holy God prayer, repeated three times: Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world. Pray the Optional Closing Prayers Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself. O Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today all mankind calls out from the abyss of its misery to Your mercy — to Your compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty voice of misery that it cries out. Gracious God, do not reject the prayer of this earth’s exiles! O Lord, Goodness beyond our understanding, Who are acquainted with our misery through and through, and know that by our own power we cannot ascend to You, we implore You: anticipate us with Your grace and keep on increasing Your mercy in us, that we may faithfully do Your holy will all through our life and at death’s hour. Let the omnipotence of Your mercy shield us from the darts of our salvation’s enemies, that we may with confidence, as Your children, await Your [Son’s] final coming — that day known to You alone. And we expect to obtain everything promised us by Jesus in spite of all our wretchedness. For Jesus is our Hope: through His merciful Heart, as through an open gate, we pass through to heaven (Diary, 1570).\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us. (Repeat three times) O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You! Then on the first beads above the crucifix pray one Our Father one Hail Mary and The Apostles Creed I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended to the dead; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. Using the Rosary beads, on the Our Father Beads say the following: Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Thy dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world. After each Eternal Father prayer, on the ten Hail Mary Beads say the following: For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world. (Repeat step 4 and 5 for all five decades). Conclude with the Holy God prayer, repeated three times: Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world. Pray the Optional Closing Prayers Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself. O Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today all mankind calls out from the abyss of its misery to Your mercy — to Your compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty voice of misery that it cries out. Gracious God, do not reject the prayer of this earth’s exiles! O Lord, Goodness beyond our understanding, Who are acquainted with our misery through and through, and know that by our own power we cannot ascend to You, we implore You: anticipate us with Your grace and keep on increasing Your mercy in us, that we may faithfully do Your holy will all through our life and at death’s hour. Let the omnipotence of Your mercy shield us from the darts of our salvation’s enemies, that we may with confidence, as Your children, await Your [Son’s] final coming — that day known to You alone. And we expect to obtain everything promised us by Jesus in spite of all our wretchedness. For Jesus is our Hope: through His merciful Heart, as through an open gate, we pass through to heaven (Diary, 1570).\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

My soul suffered the most dreadful loathing in the Garden of Olives because of lukewarm souls. They were the reason I cried out: ‘Father, take this cup away from Me, if it be Your will.’ For them, the last hope of salvation is to run to My mercy.” Most compassionate Jesus, You are Compassion Itself. I bring lukewarm souls into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart. In this fire of Your pure love, let these tepid souls who, like corpses, filled You with such deep loathing, be once again set aflame. O Most Compassionate Jesus, exercise the omnipotence of Your mercy and draw them into the very ardor of Your love, and bestow upon them the gift of holy love, for nothing is beyond Your power. Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon lukewarm souls who are nonetheless enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Father of Mercy, I beg You by the bitter Passion of Your Son and by His three-hour agony on the Cross: Let them, too, glorify the abyss of Your mercy. Amen.\n\nPray the Divine Mercy Chaplet (you can use regular Rosary beads for this):\n\nMake the Sign of the Cross. Pray the Optional Opening Prayers St. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners. O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious Blood. O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have been enough for the salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for us can never be equaled. Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy. God will not deny His mercy to anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but God’s mercy will never be exhausted.

Her family had 10 children, of which she was the third oldest. Her family was devout but poor, and her father was a carpenter.\n\nFaustina said that when she was seven years old, she adored Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and it was then that God first began calling her to consecrated religious life.\n\nShe completed school when she was 16, and like St. Therese wished to enter the convent at a young age, but her parents did not let her. So she was a housekeeper for several homes over the next few years.\n\nFaustina Searches For a Convent\n\nWhen she was nineteen years old, she saw a vision of Jesus suffering and went to the Cathedral to pray. There Jesus told her to go to Warsaw and find a convent to join.\n\nFaustina obeyed promptly, went to Warsaw without knowing anyone there, and St. James Church was the first she encountered, so she went to Mass there.\n\nAfterwards, she visited several convents, but none were willing to take her in. Then she found the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, and the Mother Superior was willing to take a chance on Faustina, provided she would work to earn her keep.\n\nFaustina was given her habit and religious name (Sister Maria Faustina) on April 30, 1926. She was twenty years old. Two years later she took temporary vows as a nun.\n\nJesus Appears to Faustina\n\nJesus, as the King of Divine Mercy, appeared to Faustina on February 22, 1931. He wore white, with red and translucent rays radiating out from his heart.\n\nJesus asked Faustina if she would be the Apostle of God’s Mercy and His missionary to the modern world for this purpose.\n\nJesus also told her to paint an image of Him with the caption “Jesus, I trust in You.”\n\nIn addition to the Divine Mercy painting, Jesus said that the Sunday after Easter was to become the Feast of Mercy.\n\nIn 1935, Faustina told of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, which she was given, for the purpose of trusting in Christ’s Divine Mercy.\n\nTwo years later, the Divine Mercy image grew in popularity, and Faustina revealed that Jesus gave her the Novena of Divine Mercy as well, which people should pray beginning Good Friday for 9 days leading up to the Feast of Divine Mercy.\n\nFaustina’s Holy Death\n\nSt. Faustina died on October 5, 1938.\n\nSt. Faustina’s diary, Divine Mercy in my Soul, was published and has been a best selling book in the Catholic world for decades.\n\nSt. Faustina was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on April 18, 1993 and canonized by him on April 30, 2000.\n\n(I am grateful to the Marians of the Immaculate Conception who have given me permission to have this novena in the Pray Catholic Novena app. It comes from the excellent book: Diary, Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, Divine Mercy in My Soul (c) 1987 Congregation of Marians of the Immaculate Conception, Stockbridge, MA 01263.
